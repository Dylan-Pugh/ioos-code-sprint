# Code Sprint tracks for 2022

This is the development page for topic ideas during the 2022 IOOS Code Sprint. Each header below identifies a track during the code sprint (essentially the room each group will be in). Within each track, various topics are identified for sprint projects.

If you have a topic you would like to focus on during a track, we recommend that you submit an [issue](https://github.com/ioos/ioos-code-sprint/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=code-sprint-project-proposal.md&title=Project+title) to this repository, identifying the scope of that topic. This will help ensure each code sprint topic has a plan that can be executed during the code sprint week. 

Expectations for topic leads: Leads are expected to identify a short plan for the code sprint topic, establish a team, and take the lead on executing said plan. 

*We've populated the tracks below with topics from the initial survey and registration forms. These topics are open for further discussion.*

To register for the Code Sprint, please see the registration website https://ioos.github.io/ioos-code-sprint/registration/.
